# The Project

In this project, an over the history of spam ham classification is given. Then use a simple yet elegant 
graph neural network design on a variety of data sets was tested and showen that graph neural networks are very efficient for 
spam ham classification. Additionally, experimently it was showen that our simpler algorithm performs better than a 
more complicated graph neural network.
