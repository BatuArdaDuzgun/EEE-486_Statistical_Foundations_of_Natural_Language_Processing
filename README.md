# The Project

In this project, an overview of the history of spam-ham classification is given. Then a simple yet elegant 
graph neural network design was tested on a variety of data sets. The testing showed that graph neural networks are very efficient for 
spam-ham classifications. Experimentally it was shown that our simpler algorithm performed better than a 
more complicated graph neural network.
